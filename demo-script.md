# DOE Tech Marketplace Chatbot Demo Script

This document outlines a scripted scenario demonstrating how the AI chatbot helps users identify the appropriate data visualization tool from the marketplace.

## Scenario: Data Scientist Looking for Visualization Tool

### Initial User Query
**User**: "I need help finding a data visualization tool for my department."

**Chatbot**: "Hello! I'm your DOE Tech Assistant. I can help you find the right data visualization tool for your needs. What kind of data are you looking to visualize?"

### Understanding User Needs
**User**: "I work with large datasets from energy consumption across multiple facilities. I need to create interactive dashboards that can be shared with stakeholders."

**Chatbot**: "That's helpful information. For large datasets and interactive dashboards, we have several options. Could you tell me a bit more about your technical expertise level and if you have any budget constraints?"

**User**: "I have moderate technical skills - I can code in Python but prefer not to build visualizations from scratch. Budget is a consideration, but we can make a case for the right tool."

**Chatbot**: "Based on what you've shared, I'd like to compare a few options for you. Tableau excels at interactive visualizations and is user-friendly but more expensive. PowerBI integrates well with Microsoft products and is more affordable. sPARC offers the most customization but requires more technical expertise. What aspects are most important for your project?"

### Exploring Options
**User**: "Integration with Microsoft products would be helpful since we use the Microsoft ecosystem. How does PowerBI handle large datasets?"

**Chatbot**: "PowerBI handles large datasets well with good performance optimization. It has built-in data compression and incremental refresh capabilities that help manage large volumes of data efficiently. It also integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft products like Excel, SharePoint, and Teams, which would benefit your workflow if you're already in the Microsoft ecosystem."

**User**: "That sounds promising. How does it compare to Tableau in terms of creating interactive dashboards?"

**Chatbot**: "Both tools excel at creating interactive dashboards, but there are some differences:

Tableau is often praised for its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and visualization capabilities. It has a slight edge in creating highly customized, complex visualizations with minimal coding.

PowerBI is catching up quickly in this area and offers strong interactive features as well. Its dashboards are very functional and it has the advantage of familiar Microsoft UI patterns if your team already uses Microsoft products.

PowerBI also offers AI-powered insights that can automatically identify trends and outliers in your data, which might be valuable for analyzing energy consumption patterns across facilities."

### Making a Recommendation
**User**: "Given our Microsoft environment and budget considerations, PowerBI sounds like it might be the better fit. Would you agree?"

**Chatbot**: "Yes, based on your requirements - working with large datasets, needing interactive dashboards, having a Microsoft environment, moderate technical skills, and budget considerations - I'd recommend PowerBI as the best fit for your needs.

It offers a good balance of powerful visualization capabilities, Microsoft integration, and cost-effectiveness. The familiar interface will also reduce the learning curve for your team.

Would you like me to help you request PowerBI through our marketplace, or would you like more specific information about PowerBI's features first?"

### Completing the Request
**User**: "I'd like to request PowerBI. How do I proceed?"

**Chatbot**: "Great choice! To request PowerBI, I can direct you to our request form. You'll need to provide some basic information about your department and specific needs.

I've pre-selected PowerBI in the form for you. You can access the request form by clicking the 'Request This Product' button on the PowerBI product page, or I can take you directly to the request form now. Which would you prefer?"

**User**: "Please take me directly to the form."

**Chatbot**: "I've opened the request form for you with PowerBI pre-selected. Please fill in your contact information and any specific requirements you have for your implementation. Our team will review your request and contact you within 2 business days to discuss next steps and arrange a demo if needed.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about PowerBI before submitting your request?"

**User**: "No, that's all I need for now. Thanks for your help!"

**Chatbot**: "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help you find the right visualization tool for your needs. If you have any other questions about PowerBI or other technology solutions, feel free to chat with me anytime. Good luck with your data visualization project!"
